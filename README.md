Python Blackjack Game
I've been learning Python for a while and this is one of my projects

A simple command-line Blackjack game written in Python.

How to Play
Run the script in your terminal or code editor.

You will be prompted to start a new game or exit by typing 'y' or 'n'.

The game will display your initial cards and the computer's face-up card.

Type 'y' to draw another card or 'n' to pass during your turn.

If your score exceeds 21, you lose. If the computer's score exceeds 21, you win. Otherwise, the one with the higher score wins.

After each game, you can choose to play again or exit.

Game Rules
The deck is unlimited in size.
There are no jokers.
The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
Enjoy the game and good luck beating the computer!
